Insertion Sort Algorithm Implementation
=====================================

Overview
--------

This is a JavaScript implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input array into a sorted and an unsorted region, and repeatedly inserting the next element from the unsorted region into the sorted region in the correct position.

Algorithm Description
--------------------

The Insertion Sort algorithm works as follows:

1. Start from the second element of the array (index 1), since the first element is trivially sorted.
2. For each element in the array, store it as the "key" to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.
3. Initialize the index of the previous element to `i - 1`.
4. Shift elements greater than the key to the right to make room for the key.
5. Insert the key into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the entire array is sorted.

Implementation
--------------

The implementation is provided in the `insertionSort.js` file, which exports a single function `insertionSort` that takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.

Example Usage
-------------

```javascript
const array = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4];
const sortedArray = insertionSort(array);
console.log(sortedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
